          Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline
          which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of hacking had taken place in 1960
          at MIT and the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated.

          Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exit in a computer system or a
          computer network and finaly entering into them. Hacking is usually done to again unauthorized
          access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the systems or to steal sensitive
          information available on the computer
      </p>
      <p>
          Hacking is usually legal as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or network system
          for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call <b>Ethical Hacking</b>
      </p>
      <p>
          A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those who seek
          knowladge, to understand how system operate, how they are desined, and then attempt to a play
          with this systems.

          We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples-
      </p>
         <b> Website Hacking</b>- Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated
          software such as database and other interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b> Network Hacking</b>- Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet,
          NS lookup, Ping, Netstat, etc. With the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation
      </p>
         <b>Email Hacking</b>- It include getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking
          the consent of its owner.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Ethical Hacking</b>-   Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing<
          purpose and finally getting them fixed.
      </p>
        <b>Password Hacking</b>- This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or
         transmitted by a computer system.
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Computer Hacking</b>- This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and
         getting unauthorized access to a computer system.

        Hacking is quite useful in the following scenarios −
               To recover lost information, especially in case you lost your password.
               To perform penetration testing to strengthen computer and network security.
               To put adequate preventative measures in place to prevent security breaches.
               To have a computer system that prevents malicious hackers from gaining access.
