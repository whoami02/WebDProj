    <p><div class="b">Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical hacking. Reconnaissance
       is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & Enumeration) used to covertly discover and collect
       information about a target system.
    </div><p>

     <p><div class="b">During reconnaissance, an ethical hacker attempts to gather as much information about a target system as possible,
       following the seven steps listed below −
     <p>

     <ol><li>Gather initial information</li>

        <li>Determine the network range</li>

         <li>Identify active machines</li>

        <li>Discover open ports and access points</li>

       <li>Fingerprint the operating system</li>

        <li>Uncover services on ports</li>

         <li>Map the network</li></ol></div>

      <p><div class="b">We will discuss in detail all these steps in the subsequent chapters of this tutorial. Reconnaissance takes
         place in two parts-
         <br><b>− Active Reconnaissance and Passive Reconnaissance.</b>

       <p><div class="b">In this process, you will directly interact with the computer system to gain information. This information can be
          relevant and accurate. But there is a risk of getting detected if you are planning active reconnaissance without
          permission. If you are detected, then system admin can take severe action against you and trail your subsequent activities.

      <p><div class="b">In this process, you will not be directly connected to a computer system. This process is used to gather essential
         information without ever interacting with the target systems.
