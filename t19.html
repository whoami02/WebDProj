    <p>Trojans are non-replication programs; they don’t reproduce their own codes by attaching themselves to other executable codes. They operate without the permissions or knowledge of the computer users.
</p>

    <p>Trojans hide themselves in healthy processes. However we should underline that Trojans infect outside machines only with the assistance of a computer user, like clicking a file that comes attached with email from an unknown person, plugging USB without scanning, opening unsafe URLs.
</p>

    <p>Trojans have several malicious functions −
</p>

    <li>They create backdoors to a system. Hackers can use these backdoors to access a victim system and its files. A hacker can use Trojans to edit and delete the files present on a victim system, or to observe the activities of the victim.
</li>

    <li>Trojans can steal all your financial data like bank accounts, transaction details, PayPal related information, etc. These are called Trojan-Banker.
</li>

    <li>Trojans can use the victim computer to attack other systems using Denial of Services.
</li>

    <li>Trojans can encrypt all your files and the hacker may thereafter demand money to decrypt them. These are Ransomware Trojans.
</li>

    <li>They can use your phones to send SMS to third parties. These are called SMS Trojans.
</li>
