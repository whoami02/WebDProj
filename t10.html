    <p><div class="b">Footprinting is a part of reconnaissance process which is used for gathering possible information about a target
       computer system or network. Footprinting could be both <b>passive</b> and <b>active</b>. Reviewing a company’s website is an example
       of passive footprinting, whereas attempting to gain access to sensitive information through social engineering is an
       example of active information gathering.
    </div><p>

     <p><div class="b">Footprinting is basically the first step where hacker gathers as much information as possible to find ways to intrude
        into a target system or at least decide what type of attacks will be more suitable for the target.
      </div><p>

      <p><div class="b">During this phase, a hacker can collect the following information −
     </div><p>

    <div class="b"><ol><li>Domain name</li> <li>IP Addresses</li> <li>Namespaces</li> <li>Employee information</li> <li>Phone numbers</li> <li>E-mails</li>
       <li>Job Information</li> </ol></div>

      <p><div class="b">In the following section, we will discuss how to extract the basic and easily accessible information about any
         computer system or network that is linked to the Internet. </div><p>

       <center><div class="x"><h2>Domain Name Information</h2></div></center>
       <hr>
       <p><div class="b">You can use <a href="http://www.whois.com"> <font color="red">http://www.whois.com/whois</font></a> website to get detailed information about a domain name information its owner, its registrar, date of registration, expiry, name server, owner's contact information, etc.

     <p><div class="b"><font color="#ff0000">It's always recommended to keep your domain name profile a private one which should hide the above-mentioned
        information from potential hackers.</font>

      <center><div class="x"><h2>Finding IP Address</h2></div></center>
    <hr>
      <p><div class="b">You can use ping command at your prompt. This command is available on Windows as well as on Linux OS. Following
         is the example to find out the IP address of tutorialspoint.com
     </div><p>

       <p><div class="b"><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com"> <font color="red">tutorialspoint.com</font></a>
      </div><p>

      <p><div class="b">It will produce the following result −
     </div><p>

      <p><div class="b"><font color="red">PING tutorialspoint.com (66.135.33.172) 56(84) bytes of data.64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq = 1 ttl = 64 time = 0.028 ms64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq = 2 ttl = 64 time = 0.021 ms64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq = 3 ttl = 64 time = 0.021 ms64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq = 4 ttl = 64 time = 0.021 ms</font>

     <center><div class="x"><h2>Finding Hosting Company</h2></div></center>
     <hr>
     <p><div class="b">Once you have the website address, you can get further detail by using <a href="https://www.ip2location.com"> <font color="red">ip2location.com website</font></a>.</div><p>   ￼

      <p><div class="b">Here the ISP row gives you the detail about the hosting company because IP addresses are usually provided by hosting companies only.

      <center><div class="x"><h2>Quick Fix</h2></div></center>
      <hr>
      <p><div class="b">If a computer system or network is linked with the Internet directly, then you cannot hide the IP address and the related information such as the hosting company, its location, ISP, etc. If you have a server containing very sensitive data, then it is recommended to keep it behind a secure proxy so that hackers cannot get the exact details of your actual server. This way, it will be difficult for any potential hacker to reach your server directly.
      </div><p>

       <p><div class="b">Another effective way of hiding your system IP and ultimately all the associated information is to go through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). If you configure a VPN, then the whole traffic routes through the VPN network, so your true IP address assigned by your ISP is always hidden.
       </div><p>

       <center><div class="x"><h2>IP Address Ranges</h2></div></center>
       <hr>
       <p><div class="b">Small sites may have a single IP address associated with them, but larger websites usually have multiple IP addresses serving different domains and sub-domains.
       </div><p>

       <p><div class="b">You can obtain a range of IP addresses assigned to a particular company using American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).
       </div><p>

      ￼

        <p><div class="b">You can enter company name in the highlighted search box to find out a list of all the assigned IP addresses to that company.
        </div><p>

        <center><div class="x"><h2>History Of The Website</h2></div></center>
      <hr>
        <p><div class="b">It is very easy to get a complete history of any website using <a href="https://www.archive.org"><font color="red">www.archive.org</font></a>.</div><p>

      ￼

      <p><div class="b">You can enter a domain name in the search box to find out how the website was looking at a given point of time and what were the pages available on the website on different dates.

      <hr>
      <p><div class="b">Though there are some advantages of keeping your website in an archive database, but if you do not like anybody to see how your website progressed through different stages, then you can request archive.org to delete the history of your website.
